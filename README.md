# LD2L-STATS
Obtains a wide variety of stats on LD2L games and saves them to an SQL DB. 
Then, stats are manually, or where possible, programatically, sorted through and we can determine who "won" certain catagories.
Other statistics are used comparitavely, to determine which hero was most picked, or which item was most bought, for example.
